<h2>Created by Anthony Ranallo and Michael Glenn as a collaborative project for the V School MEAN Stack intensive, Fall 2016.</h2>
<h3>We aren't in love with our moms (as far as we know). We just needed to make something fun and interesting, which we did here using the MEAN stack, Bootstrap, and Github.</h3>
